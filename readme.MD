This app is a clone of the know site [sleepyti.me](https://sleepyti.me/). It is made for both Andriod and iOS using React Natie (Expo) and Typescript. All credits for the idea goes to the original creators.

## From the original site

> sleepyti.me works by counting backwards in sleep cycles. Waking up in the middle of a sleep cycle leaves you feeling tired and groggy, but waking up in between cycles wakes you up feeling refreshed and alert!

> "A good night's sleep consists of 5-6 complete sleep cycles."

> "It takes the average human fourteen minutes to fall asleep."
